# DOCUMENTATION FOR VVLIB

> This lib is a collection of random, and mostly useless python fuctions, listed below

### goofitize()

> `goofitize(text: str)` is the perfect tool to mess with your text </br>
> - randomly makes letters uppercase or lowercase, turning "hello" to "HeLLo"

### vv_shuffle()

> `vv_shuffle(ts: list or str)` is (currently) a version of random.shuffle, being able to shuffle strings aswell

#### Enjoy, theres more to come, as the semester is long :)
